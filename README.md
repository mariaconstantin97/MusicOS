# MusicOS
MusicOS is a small streamming application made by some university students from FILS Politehnica. The idea behind this project is combining the features of background play in Spotify with the big library of YouTube. In addition to that the application contains no ads.

As a software implementation model we thought that the V-shaped model is the most fitting as we started with the login implementation, then tested it, continued with the login interface, tested it and so on for the rest of the application


From the point of view of the Desing Pattern we generally used the Structural pattern. We used thr application activities as adapters, audio streams worked almost like a composite and the user interface acted as facade.
